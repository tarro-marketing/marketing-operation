- **MEL**:185 (vs 175 last week, 6% w/w )
- **MQL**: 32 (vs 52 last week, -38% w/w )
    - November goal:90/243 - pacing at 37%, Behind November target

Callouts: <br> 
- **Performance Decline:** Overall performance this week is significantly lower than last week, though the total volume is consistent with weeks prior. Channels with notable drops in **MQLs** include:  
  - **Direct Mail (DM):** 12 → 7 (-42%)  
  - **Paid Search:** 9 → 4 (-56%)  
  - **WeChat:** 8 → 4 (-50%)  

- **Mixed MEL Results:** Despite weak funnel performance after MQL, **MELs increased by 6%** w/w. This was primarily driven by a surge in **WeChat MELs** (31 → 123, +297%), while other channels experienced declines:  
  - **DM:** 18 → 6 (-67%)  
  - **Paid Search:** 14 → 6 (-57%)  
  - **Email:** 41 → 11 (-73%)  <br>
- Of the 185 total MELs this week:  
  - **15 MELs** are actively being worked on by SDRs.  
  - **106 MELs** are new and remain untouched.  

- **Lead Quality:** Lead quality is showing slight improvement:  
  - **Unqualified Leads:** Down to 25 (vs. 28 last week).  
  - **Rejected Leads:** Reduced by 50% (8 vs. 16 last week).  
  The main issue appears to be **lower lead volume**, rather than quality concerns.
