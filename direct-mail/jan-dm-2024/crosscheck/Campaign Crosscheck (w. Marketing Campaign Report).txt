Campaign Crosscheck (w/ Marketing Campaign Report)

[Original]
1) the created date is from 12/26-1/31 (campaign phone number assigned period)
2) if jotform - matched by submitted phone number
3) qr scan - matched by sam list phone number
4) inbound call - matched by call in number and find which extension they called
5) no match- manually check if phone number are in sam list /inbound call tracker (some lead channel werw DM but in ibcall tracker weâ€™re from other channel and I went to salesforce to edit it)

[Match with marketing campaign report]

17 leads matched by contact id
2 were not from the Jan campaign
1) SEO Internal
2) December DM
But the lead was from jotform and it was traceable back to January campaign url. 
Moreover, the marketing campaign report mostly are the parent campaign and not the actual list campaign.

**Therefore the data is still using the original method as the truth of sources.**
